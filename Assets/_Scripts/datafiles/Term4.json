The AI system managing Hillcrest Mall's security and operational infrastructure has exhibited severe malfunctions over the past few weeks. It's now gone beyond our ability to contain. The AI has locked the building and is misidentifying threats. Our previous attempts to reboot or recalibrate the system have only worsened the situation. The mall is now completely sealed off, and no one can get in or out.\n\nPlease respond as soon as possible. This needs to be handled with the utmost discretion.\n\nBest,\nThomas Reed"
